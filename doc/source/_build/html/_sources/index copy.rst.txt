Welcome to aberdeen's project documentation!
====================================

Methodology of data gathering:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Aberdeen Technology Data Cloud (ATDC) research methodology has been honed over 40 years of data collection. 
Trained research assistants complete interviews each month to ensure that the database is as fresh as possible. 
The database provides coverage across all industries and company sizes. Aberdeen Group ATDC also leverages 
inferred content across 20 technology areas ranging from total installed PCs to the likely presence of WAN. 
This intelligence enables Aberdeen Group to develop scores through statistical modeling and application of data 
obtained that is then provided within the ATDC. From single-location companies to Fortune 1000 enterprises, 
we seek the business locations, or “sites”, which have future IT purchases, and the decision makers who have 
the influence and authority driving the purchase of significant technology installations. Respondents to ATDC’s syndicated 
interviews are IT professionals who are knowledgeable about the technology present at their locations. 
In each applicable section, all spend numbers are in local currency.^

Goal of the project:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The aim of this project is to develop a python framework that takes some features as input
and a label as output in order to build a mathematical model based on decision tree and to extract then
the rules obtained and present them as an image that can be easily interpreted by the user.

Get started:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version of code is currently only supported on Linux. It may be possible to install on Windows, 
though this hasn’t been extensively tested. Some functionality like generating the image with the decision tree rules 
from the dot file may not work as intended.

Preparing the envirement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend using Anaconda to create the virtual envirement. Anaconda is a library that includes Python and many useful 
packages for Python, as well as an environment manager called conda that makes package management simple.
Follow the installation instructions for Anaconda here_. 

.. _here: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/

Download and install Anaconda3. Then create a conda envirement from the yaml file:

.. parsed-literal::

    conda env create -f aberdeen.yml

After that, activate the new environment

.. parsed-literal::

    conda activate aberdeen

You can verify wether the new environment was installed correctly or not:

.. parsed-literal::

    conda env list


.. toctree::
