Installation
=============

Before we get started
----------------------

This version of code is currently only supported on Linux. It may be possible to execute it on Windows, 
though this hasnâ€™t been extensively tested. Some functionalities like generating the image including the
decision tree rules from the dot file may not work as intended. Please refer to the :ref:`known_bugs` section
for further information regarding this problem.

Preparing the environment
-------------------------

We recommend using Anaconda to create the virtual environment with all the libraries, packages and dependencies needed 
to run the code. Anaconda is a library that includes Python and many useful packages for Python, as well as an
environment manager called conda that makes package management simple. Follow the installation instructions for
Anaconda here_.

.. _here: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/

Download and install Anaconda3. Then create a conda environment from the yaml file as follows

.. parsed-literal::

    conda env create -f environment.yml

After that, the new environment can be activated using the following command

.. parsed-literal::

    conda activate aberdeen

You can verify whether the new environment was installed correctly by running

.. parsed-literal::

    conda env list
